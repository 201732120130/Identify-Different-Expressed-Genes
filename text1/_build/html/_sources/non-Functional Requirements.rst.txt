Non-functional requirements
===========================
        Here we explain some non-functional requirements of this software, 
        in order to bring users a better use experience.

Reaction time
-------------
        This software is suitable for all bio-gene enthusiasts around the world, 
        so the number of users may be large. When the number of users at the same 
        time is too large, that is, when the user requests too much, there may be 
        interface delays or loss of response. Or when the data analyzed by the user 
        is large, the software reaction time may be longer, but normally the reaction
        time will not exceed three seconds.

User privacy
------------
        As a public software, it is very important to protect user's privacy data, 
        and everyone's biological experiment data is hard-won. Users use this software 
        to trust us. Without user's permission, we will never disclose any data related 
        to users.

Interface design
----------------
        Considering that the vast majority of the users of this software are biogeneticists 
        or scholars, our interface design takes a simple route, aiming at simplicity and 
        conciseness, and the analysis results are directly reflected by scatter plots and tables.
